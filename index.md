# PTBC

## Data changes
- **Ethnicity** replaced with 4 binary signs: **White**, **Black**,**South.East.Asian** and **Others**
- Excluded: **DOB** and **EDD** (reason: we have age for previous pregnancy)
- All signs like *???weeks* and *???days* were changed to *???all_days* (=*???weeks*\*7 + *???days*) (for 
**Fetal.fibronectin.test.gestation**,**Gestation.at.delivery*, **Scar.measurement.gestation**, **Gestation.Cervical.length.Shortest**)
- Excluded: **Duration.of.2nd.stage..MIN.**, **Duration.of.active.second.stage..MIN.**, 
**Largest.length**,**Depth**, **Width.Largest**,**RMT**,**AMT**  (reason: a lot of missing values (more than 50%))
